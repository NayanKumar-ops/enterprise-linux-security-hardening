# Linux Bastion Host Hardening Report

This folder contains the detailed security report for the Linux bastion host hardening project.

The purpose of this report is to explain how a publicly exposed Linux server was secured by reducing its attack surface and protecting SSH access.

The report covers:
- Identification of exposed services using Nmap
- Firewall hardening using firewalld
- SSH rate limiting to reduce brute-force attacks
- Validation of security improvements using before and after scans

The work was performed in a Rocky Linux lab environment.  
Screenshots and scan results are referenced to demonstrate the effectiveness of the applied controls.
