# Linux Bastion Host Hardening – Report

# This document provides a detailed explanation of the Linux bastion host hardening project.

The report explains:
- What a bastion host is and why it needs protection
- The security risks of exposed SSH services
- Firewall hardening using firewalld
- SSH rate limiting to reduce brute-force attacks
- Validation of security controls using Nmap scans

The hardening steps were tested in a Rocky Linux lab environment.  
Before and after Nmap scans were used to measure the reduction in attack surface.

Supporting evidence such as screenshots and scan results are referenced in the main report file.
